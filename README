Purpose:
    to replace N900 original display (acx565akm) to Chinese Company TianMa display, which was used for 'Extended UI' project in 2010

Modification:
    The display parameters, due to both of them are RGB LCD
    





Problem:
    N900 doesn't send any RGB-HV signals to TianMa display

Analysis:    
    HW design - LCD_SPI bus was not connected
    SW - kernel code:
        panel_detect -> acx565akm_read -> acx565akm_transfer -> spi_message_add_tail

        panel_detect
            for N900 kernel code
                it must detect the right settings of display, init display and then display can work with RGB-HV signals
            for driving TianMa's display
                trick N900 with direct dummy settings to send RGB-HV signals





TODO
    experiment should be done
